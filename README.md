Created by Blue Team for 2019 Spring Software Engineering at Elizabethtown College

### Objective
Our original objective was to create an iterative, neural algorithm that could do basic pattern recognition on a variety of different dataset. As of v1.0 **we have accomplished this goal**

### Features
* Has an interactive shell
* Can take in data in CSV format
* Can handle non-numerical data by mapping it to integers
* Learns from supplied data
* Can be implemented in other programs (technically)
* Supports multiple inputs
* Supports multiple hidden layers
* Makes a binary assumption about data

### Planned Features
* A web panel
* Support for more than one output
* Ability to store and load pre-trained networks
* Support for more data formats
* Build a better API
* Try implemented the network into other applications
